# This module allows you to divide a container into separate viewports
# And choose what content to show inside
#
# Probably this will be tightly coupled to ui-router to
# manage multiple states
#
# Options for showing different views:
# - insert a directive
# - change a template URL
# -
angular.module 'split', []

# .service 'split', ->
# # Both the menu and the handle for dragging/swapping
# .directive 'split-handle', ->
# .directive 'split', ->
# .directive 'split-row', ->
# .directive 'split-column', ->
